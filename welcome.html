        <p>Get ready to explore a variety of tutorials and enhance your skills!</p>
        <p>Before getting started, a few useful facts:
        <ol>
          <li>Each workshop represents an RStudio instance, tailored to the workshop content with pre-installed packages.</li>
          <li>Workshops are launched for each individual participant, and can only be accessed from one active browser session at a time.</li>
          <li>DO NOT share your workshop URL (link) on any public forum (eg chat or social media), including in screenshots.</li>
          <li>You may only have 2 running workshops at once. If you launch more than 2 workshops, they will be added to a queue that will only free up once you stop a running one.</li>
          <li>These workshops are meant to be ephemeral. All data and progress is erased when a workshop is stopped.</li>
          <li>All workshops are automatically stopped 6 days after their launch.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <h2>Welcome to Smörgåsbord 2023 Participants!</h2>
        <p>We are excited to join the Galaxy Training Network team and Galaxy Community in this incredible, free, worldwide event, and offer a variety of R/Bioconductor workshops.</p>
        <p>We welcome your participation in this event, and aim to make your learning experience as easy and accessible as possible. We encourage you to ask questions and interact with instructors as well as fellow participants in the Slack channel!</p>
        <p>This is the Bioconductor Workshop Galaxy's first public event! We welcome any and all <a href="https://forms.gle/q3voxyy1TXdkiiRV6">feedback about the platform</a> throughout the event!</p>
        <p>This is also Bioconductor's first direct involvement in Smörgåsbord! We welcome feedback about the workshops and our involvement in Smörgåsbord throughout and especially at the end of the event.</p>
        <h3>Smörgåsbord 2023 Certificates</h3>
        <p>If you wish for Bioconductor to issue you a Certificate proving your succesful and active participation in Smörgåsbord 2023, you will have to meet all activity requirements.</p>
        <p>In order to prove your successful completion of a Bioconductor workshop, you will be required to export and provide your <strong>.Rhistory file from EACH completed workshop, by filling out <a href="https://forms.gle/L2iEJkhnhXYdtZD48">the following form </a>.</strong></p>
        <p>Please export your .Rhistory as soon as you are done with a workshop, to avoid the possibility of losing your progress. You will not be able to recover your .Rhistory after the workshop is stopped. Click below for more detailed information on how to export your .Rhistory file in RStudio.</p>
