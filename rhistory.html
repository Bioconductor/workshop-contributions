        <p>In order to prove your successful completion of a Bioconductor workshop, you will be required to export and provide your <strong>.Rhistory file from EACH completed workshop, by filling out <a href="https://forms.gle/L2iEJkhnhXYdtZD48">the following form </a>.</strong></p>
        <p>Please export your .Rhistory as soon as you are done with a workshop, to avoid the possibility of losing your progress. You will not be able to recover your .Rhistory after the workshop is stopped.</p>
        <h2>How to Save your .Rhistory</h2>
        <h3 id="create">1) Create the .Rhistory file</h3>
        <p>In order to save a history of the R code run in the session up to that point, you may use the built-in <a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/savehistory.html">savehistory(file=".Rhistory")</a> function in R.</p>
        <p>This can be done by running the code in the console, as shown in 1 below.</p>
        <p>After running, an .Rhistory file will be created in your Home directory, which you may access by clicking the Home button in the Files pane, as shown in 2 below.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Bioconductor/workshop-contributions/raw/main/images/rhistory-save-1.png" alt="Screenshot of running savehistory" class="screenshot">
        <h3 id="export">2) Export the .Rhistory file</h3>
        <p>In order to export the .Rhistory file, after navigating to the Home directory as shown above, you must first select the .Rhistory file by checking the appropriate box, as shown in 1 below.</p>
        <p>After selecting the file, you will have to click on the More button, as shown in 2 below, then the Export option from the dropdown menu, as shown in 3 below.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Bioconductor/workshop-contributions/raw/main/images/rhistory-save-2.png" alt="Screenshot of running savehistory" class="screenshot">
        <h3 id="download">3) Rename and download the .Rhistory file</h3>
        <p>After clicking the Export button as shown above, a new window will prompt you for the name under which to save the desired file on your own computer.</p>
        <p>We recommend changing the name for each workshop, to facilitate saving and later identifying histories from multiple workshops.</p>
        <p>Change the name by typing the desired filename in the text box as shown in 1 below, then download the file by pressing the Download button, as shown in 2 below.</p>
        <p>Generally, the resulting file will be downloaded in your Downloads folder. Note that using Incognito/Private Mode or the equivalent, can result in your downloaded files being automatically deleted when you close your browser.</p>
        <p>Depending on your Browser and Operating System settings, you might be further prompted to choose a location on your computer.</p>
        <img src="https://github.com/Bioconductor/workshop-contributions/raw/main/images/rhistory-save-3.png" alt="Screenshot of running savehistory" class="screenshot">
        <h3 id="form">4) Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/L2iEJkhnhXYdtZD48">Certificate Request Form</a></h3>
        <p>We recommend you save your Rhistory when taking long breaks from a workshop, and as soon as a workshop is completed.</p>
        <p>We might accept partial histories on a case-by-base basis, but cannot issue a certificate if no evidence of completion is provided.</p>
        <p>After the .Rhistory is saved, you will need to fill out the Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/L2iEJkhnhXYdtZD48">Certificate Request Form</a> and upload the Rhistory for EACH workshop.</p> 
        <p>You will receive your certificate via the provided email, a few weeks after the end of the event.</p>
